# BCN fire-sim

ToDo:

- Selection of different scenarios in ShinyApp
- remove previous layers of burned areas
- improve algorithm: diagonal neighbors are further away, should take longer for fire to reach them. 
- Combine with land cover, built up area
- assign prices for houses, fire fighting
- assign prices to scenarios (SAL)

- run decisionSupport analysis
